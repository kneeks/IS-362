PAGE 1 OF 1
Your task in this week’s assignment is to answer three questions:
1. What is the northernmost airport in the United States?
2. What is the easternmost airport in the United States?
3. On February 12th, 2013, which New York area airport had the windiest weather?
Being successful on this assignment requires using both:
• Your developing skills in Python and pandas, and
• Your research skills in validating your candidate answers in context.
Tasks
1. Use the information in the .CSV files found at
https://github.com/hadley/nycflights13/tree/master/data-raw for your source data.
2. Write your code using Python and pandas, and deliver it in a Jupyter notebook. You should post
your notebook in a GitHub repository, and send me a link to the notebook.
3. For each of the three questions listed above, you’ll need to verify your answers (in two cases by
searching for additional confirming information, and in the third case being alert for possible
outliers). For the first two questions above, you may want to start by generating a list of the five
northernmost or easternmost U.S. airports.
4. In addition to providing code, you should state your answers to each of the above questions (in
Markdown) in the Jupyter notebook.
5. To receive full credit, you’ll need to include in your Jupyter notebook both your code and your
documented assumptions and any changes that you
