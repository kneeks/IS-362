Your task in this week’s assignment is to load a
dataset, perform some minor cleanup and
transformation tasks, then use exploratory data
analysis to learn about the distribution of variables
and the relationship between variables.
Here is a link to the “Auto MPG” dataset in the
UC Irvine data repository:
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG
.

1. Load the data in the (yellow highlighted) Data
Folder in the file auto-mpg.data into a
pandas DataFrame.
2. Review the data and the provided data set
description.
3. Use the attribute information provided in
auto-mpg.names to name your pandas
DataFrame columns.
4. Some of the horsepower data is marked as
missing with a ‘?’. You need to replace this ‘?’
with a pandas-appropriate missing value, then
convert the column to numeric.
5. The origin column values are 1, 2, and 3.
Convert these values respectively to ‘USA’,
‘Asia’, and ‘Europe’
6. Create a bar chart that shows the distribution
for cylinders.
7. Create a scatterplot that shows the
relationship between horsepower and weight.
8. Ask, then answer (using matplotlib and
seaborn graphics capabilities) an interesting
question about the distribution of one of the
variables, or the relationship between two (or
more!) of the variables in the “Auto MPG”
dataset.
