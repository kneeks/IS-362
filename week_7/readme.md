Choose six recent popular movies. Ask at least five people that you know (friends, family, classmates,
imaginary friends) to rate each of these movies that they have seen on a scale of 1 to 5. There should be
at least one movie that not everyone has seen!
Take the results (observations) and store them somewhere (like a SQL database, or a .CSV file). Load the
information into a pandas dataframe. Your solution should include Python and pandas code that
accomplishes the following:
1. Load the ratings by user information that you collected into a pandas dataframe.
2. Show the average ratings for each user and each movie.
3. Create a new pandas dataframe, with normalized ratings for each user. Again, show the average
ratings for each user and each movie.
4. Provide a text-based conclusion: explain what might be advantages and disadvantages of using
normalized ratings instead of the actual ratings.
5. [Extra credit] Create another new pandas dataframe, with standardized ratings for each user.
Once again, show the average ratings for each user and each movie
