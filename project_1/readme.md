The chart above describes arrival delays for two airlines across five destinations.  Your task is to  (1) Create a .CSV file (or optionally, a MySQL database!) that includes all of the information below.  You may change the structure of the information as you like. (2) Read the information from your .CSV file into pandas, and perform analysis to compare the arrival delays for the two airlines. (3) Your code should be in a Jupyter (IPython) notebook (in GitHub), and should include narrative descriptions of your analysis and conclusions
